# Hemp Segmentation and Classification, a Deep Learning approach

__The yield of crops such as hemp (Cannabis) depends on various factors, such as environmental influences, location site and lighting conditions.  Therefore, the task of quantifying the volume and the number of plants per unit area as well as to classify different species in the same field is critical for plant breeders to get an exact overview of the current situation in the field. For large scale sites it is almost infeasible to manually count and estimate the volume of such fields. 
To automate this process, a machine learning approach, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), is proposed to generate pixel level segmentation maps and to estimate the number of plants on non-overlapping cases from UAV- images.
It could be shown that a reasonable number of training samples already yield good results. With post-processing steps such as majority voting which is taking shots on multiple dates into account the method delivers good results on images where it is difficult even for human individuals to label the plants correctly. 
The overall segmentation rate is above 86% measured by the dice coefficient and an accuracy of xx % regarding the plant counting is reported. The developed solution is therefore a robust method to segment and detect Hemp plants under real-world conditions.__
